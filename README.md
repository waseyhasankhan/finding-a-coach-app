# finding-a-coach-app

This VUE app focuses mainly on the core features of Vue, i.e., Vue Router, VueX and some other behind the scenes definitely.
I would like to thank the one and only Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, for his awesome course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) 
You may visit the project [here/the LIVE PREVIEW](https://finding-a-coach-app.web.app/) 
Definitely play around by signing up with some dummy id and a password.
And Yes! Do some error to test the error handling, and also try logging in with incorrect credentials, so to say!
